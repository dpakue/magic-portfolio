## What A Dedicated IP Is

A dedicated IP is an IP address that is exclusively assigned to a single hosting account or domain name. In other words, when you sign up for a web hosting service, your website will be assigned a unique IP address that is not shared with any other websites on the server. This means that your website will have its own unique identity on the internet when the dedicated IP is applied to your domain. If the dedicated IP is applied to your hosting account, then every website in your account will share the same dedicated IP address with each other, but not with any other websites on the server.  

## What A Dedicated IP Is Not

A dedicated IP should not be confused with a dedicated server. An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a number assigned to one or more devices on a network, or in this case one or more websites on server.  A server, on the other hand, is a computer program or a physical machine that provides functionality to other programs or devices, known as clients, over a network. Servers are used to store data, host websites, run applications, and provide other services to clients on a network.

In layman’s terms the server is where your website literally exists, and an IP is how your website is identified on the internet. A dedicated server then is a server exclusively leased or rented to a single customer or organization. When you opt for a dedicated server, you get complete control over the server’s resources, including the CPU, RAM, storage, and bandwidth. This means that you can configure the server according to your specific needs and requirements, and you don’t have to share the server with any other customers.

## Why You Should Consider Getting A Dedicated IP

Most standard hosting plans are on a shared IP and Server. This means that your website, or websites, will share an identity with other websites that you did not create nor have control over. Even though your website has a different domain name, it’s like having the same social security number. This matters most when it comes web filters. Web filters block sites that the client (a parent, employer, school, government, or public Wi-Fi provider like a library or coffee shop) does not want to be visited. This is done by blocking the IP address of these sites. Therefore if your website shares the same IP address as one of those blocked sites, it will also be blocked. This could dramatically decrease your ability to reach potential customers due to no fault of your own other than not opting for a dedicated IP and therefore sharing the same IP address as a site that has been blocked by a web filter. Dedicated IP’s can be pricey but losing potential customers usually costs far more.

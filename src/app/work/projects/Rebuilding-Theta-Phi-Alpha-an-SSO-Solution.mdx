## Overview

Modernizing the UI/UX of the Fraternity's national website and integrating it with member and officer portals.

## Key Features

- **Custom WordPress Theme**: Built a custom WordPress theme with reusable UI elements focusing on accessibility and responsiveness.
- **Custom WP Backend and Frontend UI based on User Roles/Permissions**: Developed custom WP backend UI for content management and front end UI for navigating integrated platforms and resources using PHP, Javascript and CSS 
- **SSO**: Implemented single-sign-on to 3 member applications (member portal, officer portal, and LMS) using OAuth / OpenID Connect (OIDC) and JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Protected Routes/Resources for Members Only**: Modified root WordPress configuration files to require member login to access directories that contained files meant for members eyes only.


## Technologies Used

- **WordPress**: For easier content management by general staff.
- **Front-End Technologies**: JavaScript, AJAX, JSON, CSS, HTML
- **Back-End Technologies**: PHP, MySQL
- **SSO**: OAuth / OpenID Connect (OIDC), JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- **Content Delivery Network**: For faster load times
- **Cloudflare**: For faster propagation and site delivery

## Challenges and Learnings

A key challenge with this project was creating a seamless flow and clear navigation between the many applications that were integrated in the site, each of which has its own application user dashboard. Navigation had to be intuitive for both new members, who have no knowledge of the applications, and old members who are used to logging in to every application separately. The solution involved creating a clear tree map of the member journey and rebranding the applications under a cohesive naming system so that members know where they are and how to navigate back to main user dashboard.

## Outcome

73% faster site load times, increased member utilization and staff productivity, and decrease in user requests for technical support.
